## Synopsis

*The ‚ÄúMacuahuiltl‚Äù Generative Art Toolbox* is a collection of personal `Python 3` scripts to
generate artworks or elements for artworks that can either be used directly or processed further
in common vector design software packages.

All scripts output `Scalable Vector Graphics` (SVG) image files directly which easily can be
loaded in common vector graphics application like `InkScape`, `Affinity Designer`, `Adobe
Illustrator`, and so on. A few of the scripts also can output a custom `JSON`-based format of
particle or shape descriptions which then can be further processed by related scripts or
imported into 3D graphic software packages like `Blender` or `CINEMA 4D` for rendering.

## The ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù and The ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Usually to automatize generation of shapes or pattern for vector illustrations ‚Äîwhich would
be *way too boring* to create manually in Affinity Designer‚Äî the scripts start out with a quick
visual idea and just a handful lines of quick code as proof of concept.

Once that's done crazy silliness starts by making every variable of the algorithm user-configurable
via a CLI interface. The result: the scripts explode in code size exponentially. Not that this
really makes a lot of sense or would revolutionize the world‚Ä¶ it's simply **fun stuff** done for
recreation. So here we are! üòÖ

## Script Overview

### Comitl

<img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Comitl/Examples/basic_01.svg" alt="Figure 1 - Comitl Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Comitl/Examples/basic_04.svg" alt="Figure 2 - Comitl Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Comitl/Examples/basic_06.svg" alt="Figure 3 - Comitl Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Comitl/Examples/basic_08.svg" alt="Figure 4 - Comitl Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Comitl/Examples/basic_02.svg" alt="Figure 5 - Comitl Example">

Comitl concentrically arranges randomly sized arcs into a pretty disc shape. Output is generated as a set of vector shapes in Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard output stream. Comitl also supports SVG animations, optional PNG output
(with `cairosvg`), and has countless of parameters for configuration of the generated shape.

### Altepetl

Altepetl implements an artful grid-based layout of "U"-shapes; inspired by some of generative art pioneer [V√©ra Molnar](http://www.veramolnar.com)'s
artworks. Output is generated as a set of vector shapes in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard output stream. Altepetl
also supports optional PNG output (with `cairosvg`), and has a handful of parameters for configuration of the generated artwork.

### Temo

<img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Temo/Examples/basic_02.svg" alt="Figure 1 - Temo Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Temo/Examples/basic_03.svg" alt="Figure 2 - Temo Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Temo/Examples/basic_04.svg" alt="Figure 3 - Temo Example"> <img width="90" height="90" src="Documentation/Temo/Examples/basic_05.svg" alt="Figure 4 - Temo Example">

Temo creates a colorful maze inspired by a famous one line C64 BASIC program (`10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10`). Output is generated as a set
of vector shapes in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard output stream. Temo also supports optional PNG output (with `cairosvg`),
and has a handful of parameters for configuration of the generated artwork.

### Teocuitlatl

Creates a grid of colored squares that are accentuated with smaller squares or discs inspired by works of *Victor Vasarely*. Additional
color palettes of works of other op-art artists including *Bridget Riley* and *Ellsworth Kelly* are included for further experimentation
with the theme. Output is generated as a set of vector shapes in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format and printed on the standard
output stream. Teocuitlatl also supports optional PNG output (with `cairosvg`), and has a handful of parameters for configuration of the
generated artwork.
